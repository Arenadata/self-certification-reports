# WANdisco Fusion Interoperable Certification

## a. Product name / version
WANdisco Fusion 2.9
Consistent replication for Hadoop

## b. Primary contact for questions on this questionnaire
Paul Scott-Murphy (paul dot scott-murphy at wandisco dot com)

## c. Which technologies governed by the ODPi Runtime Specification does this application interoperate with?
Common, HDFS, YARN, MapReduce

## d. Which ODPi compliant distributions and versions did you test with?
ODPi Reference, Hortonworks HDP 2.4.2, IBM IOP 4.2

## e. Please describe your testing procedure you use to demonstrate compatibility of a Hadoop distribution, and what passing results will be.
WANdisco conducts testing for compatibility of WANdisco Fusion with Hadoop distributions that span installation, deployment, application compatibilty, functionality behavior of replication, HA failure and recovery, operation during underlying system failure, scale and soak testing. Tests are performed on a variety of clusters, including minimal deployments for unit testing and tests on clusters with hundreds of nodes. The tests exercise cluster operation and functionality of the Fusion product. Passing results require both functional and non-functional aspects to meet expectations for correct behavior, performance, durability, availability and scale requirements.

## f. What modifications did you make to your software or underlying configurations for each distribution in order for them to pass?
No modifications were required or permitted for WANdisco tests to pass.

## g. Did you test with any ODPi compliant distributions that did not pass your interoperability tests?
No.

## h. Did you notice any different behavior in your software or the underlying distributions when you ran your tests, whether or not you deemed the tests as passing?
No.

## i. Which ODPi compliant distributions and versions do you provide support for in the deployment of your software?
Hortonworks HDP 2.4.2
IBM BigInsights 4.2
