b. Primary contact for questions on this questionnaire

Pankuj Chachra pankuj@us.ibm.com

c. Which technologies governed by the ODPi Runtime Specification does this application interoperate with?

HDFS, HBase, Oozie, MapReduce, Spark

d. Which ODPi compliant distributions and versions did you test with?

IBM BigInsights IOP 4.2, Hortonworks HDP 2.4.2

e. Please describe your testing procedure you use to demonstrate compatibility of a Hadoop distribution, and what passing results will be.

1. Run Bigmatch Derive, Compare, Link jobs. Verify the derived and linked data.  This uses Map reduce jobs (Yarn/MR2) 
2. Use the Big Match API/REST to retrieve results (search, API) . This uses Hbase Java and REST APIs. 
3. Run the PME Export bulk Job, read results from the export table. This utilizes HBase bulk load 
4. Use Apache Oozie as workflow scheduler for Big Match link workflow. 
5. Run the Bucket Analysis Big Match Oozie workflow. This utilizes Spark.

f. What modifications did you make to your software or underlying configurations for each distribution in order for them to pass?

Oozie and Hbase configuration is modified during big match install to add big match hooks/Hbase co processors.

g. Did you test with any ODPi compliant distributions that did not pass your interoperability tests?

No.

h. Did you notice any different behavior in your software or the underlying distributions when you ran your tests, whether or not you deemed the tests as passing?

No.

i. Which ODPi compliant distributions and versions do you provide support for in the deployment of your software?

Hortonworks HDP 2.4.2 , IOP 4.2
