b. Primary contact for questions on this questionnaire

Susan Malaika malaika@us.ibm.com



c. Which technologies governed by the ODPi Runtime Specification does this application interoperate with?

Common, HDFS, YARN, MapReduce

d. Which ODPi compliant distributions and versions did you test with?

IBM IOP 4.2, Hortonworks HDP 2.4.2

e. Please describe your testing procedure you use to demonstrate compatibility of a Hadoop distribution, and what passing results will be.

 The 3rd party conducts testing for compatibility of BigReplicate with Hadoop distributions that span installation, deployment, application compatibilty, functionality behavior of replication, HA failure and recovery, operation during underlying system failure, scale and soak testing. Tests are performed on a variety of clusters, including minimal deployments for unit testing and tests on clusters with hundreds of nodes. The tests exercise cluster operation and functionality of the Fusion product. Passing results require both functional and non-functional aspects to meet expectations for correct behavior, performance, durability, availability and scale requirements.

f. What modifications did you make to your software or underlying configurations for each distribution in order for them to pass?

We did not make any modifications to our software and we did not make any underlying configuration changes.

g. Did you test with any ODPi compliant distributions that did not pass your interoperability tests?

No.

h. Did you notice any different behavior in your software or the underlying distributions when you ran your tests, whether or not you deemed the tests as passing?

No.

i. Which ODPi compliant distributions and versions do you provide support for in the deployment of your software?

Hortonworks HDP 2.4.2,  IOP 4.2
